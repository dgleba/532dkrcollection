Naming


1.

The folder `538b-django-docker` here holds the docker project. It has the docker-compose.yml file within that folder.
    In this case it has a django app and a adminer for sqlite docker setup
It needs a unique name as docker compose uses the folder name to name the containers.
  A unique name will make using and maintaining the app easier.

2.

You should give your folder a unique name that fits your project.
