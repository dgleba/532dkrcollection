1.

partial.

can use {{form}} but not bootstrap html yet.

runs, but there are problems.
see https://github.com/mmcardle/django_builder/issues


2.

crispy forms.

I can do a {{ form|crispy }} ok.

I had trouble doing as_crispy_field.

I should try the repo at the bottom of this article.

https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/11/28/advanced-form-rendering-with-django-crispy-forms.html

I can't find many tutorials that show custom layout/html/template usage with crispy

I saw a tutorial youtube that said it was about not using templates, but doing the layout in forms.py
